# Supervised  and Unspervised Learning in R

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Unsupervised Learning Project Intro/Objective

Kira Plastinina is a Russian fashion designer and enterpreneur that runs a fashion retail brand - Kira Plastinina. The brand mostly sold its products through a series of now defunct retail stores, the brand is now mostly sold through its e-commerce platform https://kiraplastinina.com/

The company has been keeping customer records from the above sales points, the marketing and sales team would like to use he past one year's data to better understand their customer demographic. The team would like to understand what clusters the customers belong to, this will be used in both sales and advertsing to better target specific ads and sales strategies to the clusters based on their characteristics. 

Working as a consultant for the two departments we will be helping the teams understand their customer clusters by heling them identify unifying characteristics of the cluster.

### Methods Used

* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perfoming Univariate analysis - mean, mode, median, quantile etc
* Visualisations - histograms, barplots
* Performing multivariate and bivariate analysis
* Unsupervised Machine Learning - K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering

## Supervised Learning Project Intro/Objective

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

### Methods Used

* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perfoming Univariate analysis - mean, mode, median, quantile etc
* Visualisations - histograms, barplots
* Performing multivariate and bivariate analysis
* Supervised Machine learnign - SVM, LM, KNN
